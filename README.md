**Project Title: Keylogger with Webhook Integration**

**Description:**
This Python script acts as a basic keylogger, recording keypresses along with timestamps and sending them to a designated webhook URL periodically. It utilizes the `requests` library for HTTP requests and `pynput` for keyboard monitoring. The script captures both character keys and special keys (e.g., function keys) and sends the collected data in JSON format to the webhook URL.

**Installation:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/msadeghkarimi/keylogger-webhook.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Usage:**
1. Replace the `webhook_url` variable value with your webhook URL.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python keylogger.py
   ```
3. The script will start logging keypresses in the background.
4. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the script.

**Features:**
- Records keypresses along with timestamps.
- Handles character keys and special keys.
- Sends collected data to a webhook URL periodically.

**Notes:**
- This script is intended for educational purposes and should be used responsibly.
- Ensure that you have appropriate permissions before running the script on a system.
